        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Cordon Bleu is a schnitzel that is filled with cheese and ham, breaded with crumbs and deep-fried until it is crisp. The characteristic of this dish is a crunchy outside, and inside tender flesh which oozes melted cheese.</p>
        <p>Classic cordon bleu is made with veal or pork, however, in recent times it has become popular to use turkey or chicken instead.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
