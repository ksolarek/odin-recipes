   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Carpaccio is an Italian appetizer of thinly sliced raw meat drizzled with lemon juice and olive oil. It's traditionally made with beef, but can be made with fish (specifically salmon or tuna), veal, or venison.</p>
   <p>These days, "carpaccio" is used to refer to pretty much anything that's been thinly sliced and drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice. It's not uncommon to see vegetarian carpaccio on menus, comprised of thinly sliced fruit or vegetables.</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>1 pound beef tenderloin</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons lemon juice, divided</li>
    <li>2 anchovies</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
    <li>4 cups baby arugula</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup capers</li>
    <li>1/2 cup shaved Parmesan cheese</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
    <li>Wrap beef very tightly in plastic wrap and place in the freezer until just slightly firm, about 1 hour. Chill 4 large plates in the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, prepare sauce. Combine mayonnaise, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, anchovies, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in the bowl of a food processor. Blend until smooth and set aside.</li>
    <li>Remove plastic wrap from beef. Using a very sharp knife, carefully slice paper-thin slices of beef. Arrange beef in a single layer divided among 4 chilled plates.</li>
    <li>Toss arugula with remaining lemon juice and pepper, olive oil, and salt. Place arugula mixture in the center of the beef.  Drizzle evenly with reserved sauce; sprinkle with capers and cheese. Serve immediately with baguette slices.</li>
   </ol>
